## Assignment 1: CPU Schedulers Simulator

### Supported Schedulers
This program simulates four CPU scheduling algorithms, each handling context switching and preemption:
1. **Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)** with context switching.
2. **Round Robin (RR)** with a configurable time quantum and context switching.
3. **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**, with the starvation problem solved.
4. **AG Scheduling**:
   - Each process is provided with a static time quantum.
   - A process is scheduled with various techniques (FCFS, Priority, SJF) in a dynamic manner based on how much of its quantum is used.
   - Quantum adjustments are made based on process execution.

### Program Input
For each CPU scheduling algorithm, the following inputs are required:
- Number of processes.
- Round Robin time quantum (for RR).
- Context switching time.
- For each process:
  - Process name.
  - Arrival time.
  - Burst time.
  - Priority.

### Program Output
For each scheduling algorithm, the following will be output:
- The order of process execution.
- Waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
- Average waiting time and average turnaround time.
- **For AG Scheduling**: a history of quantum time updates for each process will be printed.

## Assignment 2: Memory Allocation Simulator

This program simulates various memory allocation policies for allocating variable-sized partitions to a sequence of process requests.

### Supported Allocation Policies
The simulator supports the following memory allocation strategies:
1. **First-Fit**: Allocates the first partition that is large enough to fit the process.
2. **Best-Fit**: Allocates the smallest partition that fits the process.
3. **Worst-Fit**: Allocates the largest available partition to the process.

### Compaction
The user can choose whether to apply **compaction**, which consolidates free memory into a single large block to avoid fragmentation.

### Program Input
- Number of partitions and their sizes.
- Number of process requests and their sizes.
- The allocation policy (First-Fit, Best-Fit, or Worst-Fit).

### Program Output
- The allocation of processes to partitions.
- External fragmentation in partitions that are not fully utilized.
- Whether a process cannot be allocated (if there is not enough memory).
- Option to perform compaction and reallocate processes if needed.

## Assignment 3: Multithreading Producer-Consumer Problem

This program uses multithreading to simulate a **producer-consumer** problem, where a producer generates prime numbers and the consumer writes them to a file.

### Prime Number Generation
- The **Producer** thread generates prime numbers from 0 to N and schedules them in a queue.
- The **Consumer** thread retrieves the primes from the queue and writes them to a file.

### Locking and Thread Synchronization
- The **Consumer** thread holds a lock when operating on the queue, releases it when the queue is empty, and notifies all other threads when done.
- This ensures proper synchronization between the producer and consumer threads.

### Program Output
- A file containing the prime numbers generated by the producer.
- Real-time updates on queue status and thread activity.
